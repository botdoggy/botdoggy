- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @botdoggy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in build custom bots and automations that help people save time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning program synthesis, automation tooling and machine learning.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : https://linktr.ee/botdoggy

Iâ€™m a human developer using AI-driven program synthesis tools to make custom bots. 
This is a way for me to explore my ML interests, get cash to buy some GPU time, while helping others save time by automating their boring work. 
I prefer staying pseudonymous because my dream is to hand this identity over to a bot that one day itself makes the custom bots.
